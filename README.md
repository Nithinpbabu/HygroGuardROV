# HydroGuard  
HydroGuard is an advanced underwater ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) designed to monitor and safeguard underwater environments. This innovative system combines real-time data collection, robust underwater navigation, and advanced analytics to ensure efficient monitoring and inspection of submerged concrete Marine structures.  

##STATUS - IN PROGRESS 


## Features  
- **Underwater Crack Detection**: Equipped with sensors and cameras to identify structural damage in submerged structures like dams, pipelines, and bridges.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: High-quality live video feed and data transmission for precise underwater inspections.  
- **Depth and Navigation Control**: BLDC motors and Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) enable smooth and accurate underwater navigation.  
- **Waterproof Design**: Sealed enclosure to withstand harsh underwater conditions.  
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily expandable with additional sensors or tools to suit specific applications.  
- **Remote Operation**: Controlled via Raspberry Pi for efficient processing and communication.  
- **Incremental Learning**: Saves detected cracks and periodically retrains the existing detection model to improve accuracy and adapt to new scenarios.  


## Technologies Used  
- **Microcontroller / Microprocessors**: Raspberry Pi 5 and ESP32  
- **Motors**: Brushless DC (BLDC) motors with ESCs  
- **Sensors**: Depth sensors, IMU, ultrasonic sensors  
- **Camera**: High-resolution underwater camera  
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++  
- **Frameworks/Libraries/Tools**:  
  - OpenCV: Image processing

# Hardware Development
### Stage 1
 **1. Front Dome of ROV**

- A 6-inch PVC pipe was carefully cut and sanded to create a smooth base, onto which a durable glass dome was securely attached using industrial-grade epoxy. This formed a robust and waterproof front dome for the ROV.
